# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project, the project is based on Louise’s play fundraising goal in a short amount of time 

### Purpose, the purpose of this project is to identify the different campaigns in relation to the launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date- In the Outcome analysis the Pivot tables was conducted to determine a view by filtering our chosen data after it's been set to a graph.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals-In the Outcome based on Goal analysis COUNTIFS was used with certain criteria based on the data was given. It’s a visualization of the data so that we can see the outcomes of all the categories

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered- There were couple of challenges, the most challenging was figuring out the formula for the COUNTIFS in the Analysis of outcome based on Goal. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? I have concluded that the category for play was most successful during May or the year. Also, October had the highest of Failed for the theater category.    

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? That the percentage of the successful and percentage of the fail overlap one and other. If the percentage is successful rises up than the percentage of fail drops

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The limitation was that not enough gathered data from every category to support our answer  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other data we could have possible use, is create different category of the subcategory and create pivot table.
